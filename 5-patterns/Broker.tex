\item [Traceability]
The use of the Broker pattern can be found in the proxy package in the source code:\\
\verb| docker/pkg/proxy/tcp_proxy.go|\footnote{\url{https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/pkg/proxy/tcp_proxy.go}}.

\item [Issue]
Docker consists of multiple processes. For example, the client and daemon are separate processes and also the plugins are separate processes.

These processes have to communicate with each other. However, dealing with the challenges of inter-process communication in the application code would greatly increase the complexity.
The application components should be shielded form the details of the inter-process communication.

\item [Assumptions/Constraints]
\begin{mynesteditemlist}
\item All the communication between the components in different processes have to go via the Broker.
\end{mynesteditemlist}

\item [Solution]
Use a Broker to separate the logic for communication between the processes from the application functionality. Use a component-based model (using Proxies) to allow local components to invoke methods on components in remote processes as if they were local.
Using the broker pattern allows the daemon to communicate with the plugins, without requiring direct access to these plugins.
Also, because the subsystem component has the same interface as its proxy, the implementation of software using this component does not depend on whether the proxy is used or the original subsystem.


\item [Rationale]  
The Broker pattern allows for and handles all the communication between the different processes. 

This means that the logic for inter-process communication does not have to be implemented on a per-component basis.

\item [Implications]
Using the Broker pattern is good for the portability, because it does not matter if a component is part of a different process (running locally or remotely).

This pattern is also good for the security, since the Broker is a single entry point for all the inter-process communication, which makes it easier to secure. This has been done by using Transport Layer Security for the communication between the processes.

Additionally, the interoperability (compatibility) is increased, because it becomes possible for two components (in two different processes) to exchange information. 

The Broker does however introduce a performance overhead, which decreases the performance efficiency.
