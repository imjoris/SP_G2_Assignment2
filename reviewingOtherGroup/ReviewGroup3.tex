\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
	\item It is not explicitly mentioned which version of KeePass is used in this document.

\end{itemize}

\section{Requirements}
\begin{itemize}

\section{Software Architecture}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Why did you use only logical view and process view? Why not the other views? Please add rationale of using these views.
	\item Figure 1 has less explanation, only sub chapters (3.1.1-3.1.8) explain that. For example, please explain what do the arrows mean (the direction, etc.).

	\item It is nice that source code is also referenced in this chapter.
	\item Please show the relation between SA and pattern docs.
	\item It would be nicer if each pattern documentation is also written with a graph explaining it.
	\item Related patterns are missing in pattern description.
	\item For implication in pattern description, please also relates those patterns with the key drivers. For example, does that pattern support or hinder the key drivers?
	\item Some pattern descriptions are not completed. Please complete those.
