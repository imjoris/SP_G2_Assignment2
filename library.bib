    ABSTRACT =      {
Cloud computing makes extensive use of virtualmachines (VMs) because they permit workloads to be isolatedfrom one another and for the resource usage to be somewhatcontrolled. However, the extra levels of abstraction involved invirtualization reduce workload performance, which is passedon to customers as worse price/performance. Newer advancesin container-based virtualization simplifies the deployment ofapplications while continuing to permit control of the resourcesallocated to different applications.
