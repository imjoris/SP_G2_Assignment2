This pattern gives positive implication to portability as clear separation of
containers, Docker daemon, Docker registry, and Docker client makes Docker
portable and loosely coupled. Utilizing Docker registry also promotes sharing
images, which make it easier to deploy an application without knowing what
platform running below it. Exposing TCP/IP connection, specifically REST,
contributes to negative effect on the security. It means that any unwanted
connections or attacks could possible exploit this hole. However, this weak
point is compensated by other patterns. 

Furthermore, decoupling some components
means that the components below or above can be replicated in order to gain more
reliability as it has more availability. Thus, this patterns give positive
effect to the reliability. 

The summary of the Layers pattern evaluation is shown
in FRM in Figure \ref{fig:layers-frm}.
