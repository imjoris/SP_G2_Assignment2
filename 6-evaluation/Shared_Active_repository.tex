\subsection{Shared/Active repository} 
The use of the Shared Repository pattern has different impacts on the different key Drivers : \\ 
% Explaining how it works and the KD matched
\textbf{Reliability} \\
'A reliable service is one that notifies the user if delivery fails, while an "unreliable" one does not notify the user if delivery fails.'  \textit{Wikipedia} \\
According to this definition we can consider that the registry is reliable because in case a push command doesnt work the user is notified (same system as Github for example) by an error message/prompt and can try again. \\

\textbf{Security} is enhanced because the access to the registry is controlled by a login and passwords for the users. \\
Moreover,the push and pull commands in the registry are also secure (see Brokered Authentication Pattern). \\
\textbf{Portability} The docker registry is good for portability because whatever the environement of the user everybody can suscribe and access this functionnality.\\

The Shared Repository pattern has effects on other quality attributes such as integrability, modifiability and reusability.
