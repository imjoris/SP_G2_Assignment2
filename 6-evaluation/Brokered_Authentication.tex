\subsection{Brokered Authentication}
% Process 
\textbf{Reliability} can be an issue :
The centralized authorization service can be a single point of failure. It may need to be online and available and if not the client can't get his token. If the authentication brokered becomes unavailable the registry and the client can't communicate with each other.
texti{Solution :} redundant or back-up authentication broker. \\
\textbf{Security} is ensured because the registry and the client don't communicate directly, the Bearer token is a barrier of protection between the two components.\\
However security tokens must be signed by the authentication broker. If they are not, their integrity cannot be verified. This could result in attackers trying to issue false tokens. \\
\textbf{Portability} isn't affeced by the use of this pattern. \\
