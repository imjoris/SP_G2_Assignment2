\label{ch:archreview}
This chapter presents the evaluation of documented patterns and overall system architecture
against the key drivers of the architecture presented in Section \ref{sec:keydrivers}. The  Pattern-Based Architecture Reviews (PBAR) \cite{pbar} method is used to carry out the
evaluation. Force Resolution Maps (FRM) are also utilized to present the result.
