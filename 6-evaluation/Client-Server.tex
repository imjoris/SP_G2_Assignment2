For the Client-Server pattern, the portability of the system increases, because the client and server (daemon) can be located on completely different systems.

The security has a slight negative impact because for communication between the client and server to be possible, the client and server have to expose an interface, which has to be secured. 

Reliability also has a small negative impact, because the communication between client and server relies on underlying communication infrastructure that could fail.
